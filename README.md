# Git Practice

I found [this article](https://www.theverge.com/24221978/github-thomas-dohmke-ai-copilot-microsoft-openai-open-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com) interesting.

In the article, GitHub’s CEO shares his insights on AI and its growing role in **software development**. With Copilot now integrated into VS Code, using multiple AI models, we can see how the software engineering experience is evolving as AI becomes more powerful. Rather than replacing programmers, it serves as a tool to enhance productivity.

One particularly interesting point is his advocacy for **transparency and user consent in AI model training**, which addresses a major concern in the industry. Last semester, I took a class called AI and Its Discontents, where we discussed **surveillance capitalism**—the practice of profiting from user data without explicit consent. This connects directly to the ethical implications of AI in software development, making the CEO’s stance on transparency especially relevant.
